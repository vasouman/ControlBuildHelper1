# ControlBuildHelper
A java Spring MVC application that automates the not very up to date build and deploy process we have at work for the "Control" project. While the build and deploy process is very custom and the app is definitely not meant to be easily, if at all, used with other projects, it has lot's of functionality that may come handy for all sorts of other tasks. The app is Spring MVC (no Maven), reads and writes Excell files using POI library, works with SVN repository using SVNkit, starts external executables and intercepts the console output, persists and restores its state using synchronization and interceptors, loads and saves property files, provides a log polling service
